We have combined several Meetup groups for the Summer of 2016 to work
together to make improvements on Exercism.io and other open source projects.

As a community we have all learned a lot through exercism
and want to give back while comtinuing to learn together by working 
on issues. We are happy to help Katrina Owens in this way as a think you
for all of her hard work, effort, clarity of code and comments.
