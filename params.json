She was nice enough to work with us on her excellent open source project [exercism.io](http://www.exercism.io/) which is a site where you can practice your coding skills in multiple languages and get feedback about your code.  \r\nAs the site states: \r\n> \"Exercism began as a way to support students learning to code by giving them practice problems and real world feedback.\"\r\n\r\n### LAXercism Contributors\r\n+ Kalisa Falzone (@kalisafalzone)\r\n+ Ash Lopez (@ashlopez)\r\n+ Jen Diamond (@jendiamond)\r\n\r\nThis blog will document our progress while contributing to exercism.io and working with Katrina and each other.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
